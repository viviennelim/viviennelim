- 👋 Hi, I am a writer and software designer.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting together with software developers to exchange ideas on software development and usability. Also open to meetting with ux/cx folks, architects, artists, and other writers to exchange ideas about cultural evolution and application design. Two different things, but yes.. my interests are many.
- 🌱 I am SAFe 5.0 certified, and am also currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some application ideas and design initiatives
- 📫 How to reach me? Text me at 314.397.0089
